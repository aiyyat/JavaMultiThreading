/**
 * Need for Volatility.
 * 
 * Some JVMs try to Optimize variables by caching it when it comes to thread as
 * if no other thread would be expected to be modifying the variable. These
 * thread cached variables are local copies to threads and hence a change from
 * outside the thread is not visible to the thread itself. The following program
 * without volatile could potentially go into an infinite loop with some JVMs.
